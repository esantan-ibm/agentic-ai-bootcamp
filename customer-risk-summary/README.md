### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git@github.com:esantan-ibm/agentic-ai-bootcamp.git
```

### 3. Navigate into the project

```bash
cd customer-risk-summary
```

### 4. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv envadk
```

### 5. Install ADK and Validate

```bash
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate

orchestrate --version
orchestrate --help
```

### 6. Add Watsonx Environment

```bash
orchestrate env add -n <name> -u <service-instance-url>
```

### 7. Activate Environment

```bash
orchestrate env activate <name>
# You will be prompted to enter the WXO API key
```
### 8. Create `.env` File at fsm-agentic-ai-bootcamp/customer-risk-summary/tools (Not Required for present tools, but for future tools that require credentials)

Create a `.env` file with the following (if you are using any credentials in any custom tools):

```env
COS_ENDPOINT =
COS_API_KEY_ID =
COS_INSTANCE_CRN =
COS_BUCKET_NAME =
API_KEY =
PROJECT_ID =
IBM_CLOUD_URL =
```

### 9. Import Tools & Agents

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

./import-all.sh
```

### 10. Test on Orchestrate UI

Ask questions like:

* Show me the pending KYC applications for review

* Start review for Ryan Hogan's application

* Show the KYC requirements summary for this customer

* Why is the risk level of this customer high?

* Show the risk profile summary for customer id - cust001

* Review the recent transactions for this customer
