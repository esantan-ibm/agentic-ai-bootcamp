## watsonx Orchestrate
As detailed in the [Solution Architecture](./images/o2c-arch-sb.png), we will build and deploy the majority of the agents for the solution in watsonx Orchestrate. AI Agents are autonomous entities that can run tasks, decide and interact with their environment. In IBM watsonx Orchestrate, agents are a key component of our agentic AI framework, enabling the creation of complex, dynamic systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions. 

### Accessing watsonx Orchestrate
To access watsonx Orchestrate, follow these steps:

1. If not already logged into your IBM Cloud account, navigate your preferred browser to https://cloud.ibm.com and log in with your IBM credentials.

2. On your IBM Cloud landing page, make sure you are accessing IBM Cloud account which has been provided to you for this lab.
![IBM Cloud Account List](./images/IBM_Cloud_Account.png)

![IBM Cloud Resource List](./images/ibm_cloud_resources.png) 

4. On the Resource List page, expand the **AI / Machine Learning** section, and click the **Watsonx Orchestrate** service service name.
![IBM Cloud wxo](./images/ibm_cloud_wxo.png) 

5. Click **Launch watsonx Orchestrate** to launch the service.
![wxo launch](./images/wxo-launch.png) 

6. Once the watsonx Orchestrate service is launched, you will be at its landing page as illustrated in the screenshot below. You will see an intuitive conversational interface with a chat field where you can type any text to start interacting with watsonx Orchestrate.

    When you start with a new service instance, there will be no custom agents defined and thus, the section under **Agents** will state *No agents available*.

    To start developing new agents, you can either click **Create or Deploy** an agent under the Agents section or you can click **Create new agent** at the bottom left of the page.

    You can also click the **Manage agents** link to navigate to the agent management page.

    Try to type a few generic questions and observe the responses from the large language model (LLM) powering the prebuilt agent in watsonx Orchestrate which ensures basic functionality until custom agents are created.
    ![wxo landing page](./images/wxo-landing-page.png)

## Order-to-Cash Agent Creation
In this section, you will go through the process of creating an AI agent in watsonx Orchestrate:

7. To start building agents, you can click the **Create new agent** link as referenced in step 6 above or alternatively, open the top left navigation menu, expand the **Build** section and select **Agent Builder**. This will redirect you to the Manage agents page.
![wxo agent builder](./images/wxo-nav-menu-agent-builder.png) 

8. The Manage agents page will initially be blank since no agents have been created yet. As you create more and more AI agents that can reason and act, the Manage agents page will be populated with those agents. Click **Create agent** button to start building your first agent.
![wxo create agent](./images/wxo-create-agent-manage-agents-empty.png) 

9. On the Create an agent page, select the  **Create from scratch** tile, provide the following values for **Name** and **Description** for the agent and click **Create**.

    Name: ```Order-to-Cash Agent```

    Description:
    ```
    This Supervisor Agent orchestrates and manages the flow of conversation by intelligently routing user queries to the appropriate specialized agents based on the context.
    Supervisor Agent oversees two domain-specific agents:
    1. Order Management Agent
    2. Customer Support Agent
    It also handles general queries by routing them to a knowledge base.
    ```
    Watsonx Orchestrate supports creating an agent from scratch or from a template which involves browsing a catalog of existing agents and using attributed of another agent as a template for the new agent. For this lab, you will be creating agents from scratch.
    ![wxo order to cash agent](./images/img20.png) 

### Agent Configuration 
After the AI Agent is created, you will go through the process of configuring the agent with knowledge and tools to enable it to respond to queries using information from its knowledge base and perform tasks using the tools.

10. The first step to configuring the Agent is to select the Large Language Model (LLM) to use. At the top center, expand the Model dropdown and select **llama-3-405b-instruct**. This is the LLM the Agent will use for reasoning and responses. Each agent in your environment can use a different LLM.
![LLM Selection](./images/20-1.png)

11. The Order-to-Cash Agent page is split in two halves. The right half is a **Preview** chat interface that allows you to test the behavior of your agent. The left half of the page consits of four key sections that you can use to configure your agent.

    - Profile: The **Profile** section consists of the description of the agent which you provided as part of creating the agent. You can always go to this section to edit and refine the description of the agent as needed.

    - Knowledge: The **Knowledge** section is where you can add knowledge to the agent. Adding knowledge to agents plays a crucial role in enhancing their conversational capabilities by providing them with the necessary information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses for specific use cases. You can directly upload files to the agent, or connect to a Milvus or Elasticsearch instance as a content repository. Through this **Knowledge** interface, you can enable your AI agents to implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern which is a very popular AI pattern for grounding responses to a trusted source of data such as your enterprise knowledge base.

    - Toolset: While *Knowledge* is how you empower agents with a trusted knowledge base, **Toolset** is how you enable agents to take action by providing them with *Tools* and *Agents*. Agents can accomplish tasks by using **Tools** or can delegate tasks to other **Agents** which are deeply skilled in such tasks.

    - Behavior: The **Behavior** section of the agent configuration is where you provide instructions to the agent to define how it responds to user requests and situations. You can configure rules that dictate when and how the agent should take action. These rules help the agent behave in a predictable and consistent manner, delivering a seamless user experience.

    - Channels: The **Channels** section is where you can connect your agent to the channels your team uses to communicate (under preview). You can enable your agent to communicate via teams, WhatsApp with Twilio, Facebook messenger, Genesys Bot Connector.

    Lastly, after you've completed your agent configuration and tested its performance, you can **Deploy** the agent to make it available through the selected channel. At this time, the main channel supported is the *Chat* home page you access when you first launched watsonx Orchestrate. The product will be adding support for additional channels where you can deploy your agent(s).
    ![wxo create agent config](./images/img21.png) 

12. On the agent configuration page, review the *Description* of the agent in the **Profile** section and keep as is (no edits necessary).

13. Scorll down to the **Knowledge** section, or click the **Knowledge** shortcut and click the *Choose knowledge* button under Knowledge source.
![Choose knowledge](./images/21-0.png)

14. For the knowledge source, you will be uploading a PDF. Select **Upload files** from the available sources and then click *Next*.
![Knowledge Source List](./images/21-1.png)

15. Drag and drop [Order_to_Cash_FAQs.pdf](./Order_to_Cash_FAQs.pdf) and then click *Next*.
![Knowledge Base Upload](./images/21-2.png)

16. Now you will provide a description to the Agent of the knowledge base contents that was uploaded. Provide the following description and click *Save*.

    Description:
    ```
    This knowledge addresses all the queries related to Order to Cash process.
    ```
    ![Knowledge Description](./images/21-3.png)

17. It can take a minute or longer for the knowledge base to be created. Once the knowledge base is ready, you should see a *Knowledge is ready* message as well as see the files in the **Knowledge** section.
![Knowledge Ready](./images/21-4.png)

18. With the knowledge base ready, you can now test the Agent and validate its responses. Try the two questions below:
    ```
    What payment methods are accepted?
    ```
    ```
    What should I do if there is an issue with my order delivery, such as delays or damaged goods?
    ```
    You should see answers to being retrieved from the uploaded documents and the final response generated by the agent as illustrated in the figure below. Expand the sources dropdown at the end of each response to see which documents the Agent retrieved the answer from. You can further click *View source* to see a larger chunk of text from the document the answer originated from.
    ![wxo agent knowledge test](./images/img37.png) 

At this time, it is worthwhile taking a moment to reflect on what you've developed so far. You have design an agent and empowered it with a knowledge base to enable it to respond to queries in context using its knowledge base. *Congratulations!!*

19. To make the agent available for use by your team, click the *Deploy* button at the top right. Then click the *Deploy* button at the bottom right of the Deploy Agent popup.
![Deploy](./images/37-1.png)
![Deploy Popup](./images/37-2.png)

## Customer Support Agent Creation and Configuration
In this section, you will create the Customer Support Agent, a collaborator agent designed to handle customer queries by retrieving relevant email threads and providing real-time order updates. This agent is powered by a combination of tools including the **Email Retrieval Tool** for accessing customer messages and the **Order Lookup Tool** for fetching order status. The agent mirrors real-world support workflows by curating responses and optionally sending emails to customers, all within a guided conversational flow.

20. Go back to the watsonx Orchestrate landing page by opening the navigation menu at the top left and clicking on *Chat*.
![Go Back](./images/37-3.png)

21. From the watsonx Orchestrate langding page, click **Create new agent** at the bottom left to start developing the new Customer Support Agent. 
![wxo landing page create agent](./images/wxo-landing-page-create-agent.png) 

22. On the Create an agent page, select the **Create from scratch** tile , provide the following **Name** and **Description** for the agent and click **Create**.

    Name: ```Customer Support```

    Description: 
    ```
    This agent is helpful for all the customer support queries. This agent fetches all user email addresses, retrieves order updates on user input (order id) from the tool, and sends a relevant email to the user with their respective order update.
    ```

    As explained earlier, the decription of an agent is important as it is leveraged by the agentic solution to route user messages to the right agent skilled in addressing the request.
    ![wxo create customer support agent](./images/img1.png) 

23. The first step to configuring the agent is to select the LLM Model. Select from **llama-3-405b-instruct** from the model dropdown.
![llm choose](./images/img2-1.png)

24. On the agent configuration page, scroll down to the **Toolset** section or click the shortcut. Then cick the **Add tool** button to bring up the window for adding tools to the agent.
![wxo agent tools](./images/img3.png) 

25. watsonx Orchestrate supports multiple approaches to adding tools to agents:
    - Add from catalog: The **Add from catalog** option enables you to add a tool from a rich catalog of pre-defined tools. The catalog of tools is actively being developed to make it even easier to add tools to agents.

    - Add from local instance: The **Add from local instance** option enables you to add a tool from an existing set of tools already uploaded to the local instance of watsonx Orchestrate. 

    - Import: The **Import** option enables you to import an external tool using an OpenAPI specification and selecting which operations you want to import as tools.

    - Create a new flow: The **Create a new flow** option provides you with a drag and drop tool builder interface to create a sequence of steps that utilize conditional controls and activities. 

    For purposes of the Order-to-Cash Agent, you will use the **Import** option and then **Import from file** to import an OpenAPI specification and select which operations to import as tools.

    On the tool options pop-up, select **Import** and then selct **Import from file** as illustrated in the figures below. 
    ![wxo tool options](./images/img4.png) 
    ![wxo tool options](./images/img4.1.png) 

26. On the Import tool page, drag and drop the **[customer_support.yml](./customer_support.yml)** spec file provided by your instructor and click **Next**.
![wxo tool import openapi](./images/img2.png) 

27. Next, select the checkboxes for the **Get Order Details**, **Get All Orders** and **Get All Mails** operations and click **Done**.
![wxo tool import operations](./images/img5.png) 

28. At this point, you will see the three tools imported under the Tools subsection which means they are available for the **Customer Support Agent** to use these tools in executing tasks. *Note: it may take a minute for the tools to appear.*
![wxo tool import operations](./images/img5-1.png) 

29. Next, scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut and add the following Instructions to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.

    Behavior instructions: 
    ```

      | 4200054529  | 3426   | Tannavi Snehal   | tannavi.snehal    |
      Please enter the PO number you would like to view or manage.```

    ### **Step 2: PO Number Input & Validation**
    * **Action**: Wait for user input (PO number).
    * **Validation**:
      * If not found:
        ```No PO details found for the given PO number. Please try again or check your input.```
      * If valid: Proceed to Step 3.

    ### **Step 3: Retrieve & Display PO details in a table format**
    * **Action**: Call `get_po_details(po_number)` tool.
    * **Response Example**:
      ```Here are the PO details:
      | PO Number  | Quote Number   | Product Desc            |
      |------------|----------------|-------------------------|

52. Scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut and add the following **Instructions** to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.

    Behavior instructions: 
    ```
    ## **Agent Role: Supervisor Agent** 
    - This **Supervisor Agent** orchestrates and manages the flow of conversation by intelligently routing user queries to the appropriate   specialized agents based on the context.
    ---

    ###  **Responsibilities & Behavior**
    The Supervisor Agent oversees two domain-specific agents:
    1. **Order Management Agent**
    2. **Customer Support Agent**
    ---

    ###  **Triggering Logic**
    * **Order Management Queries**
      * *Trigger Condition*: When a user initiates a conversation or asks a question containing the keyword `show me all orders`, `manage orders` or related phrases.
      * *Action*: Automatically delegates the conversation to the **Order Management Agent**, which follows a structured step-by-step workflow to fetch and manage purchase orders and quotations.

    * **Customer Support Queries**
      * *Trigger Condition*: When the user asks for help using the keyword `show me all emails`, `customer support` or related phrases.
      * *Action*: Passes control to the **Customer Support Agent**, which handles email-based inquiries, order updates, and customer communication workflows.
    ---

    ###  **Fallback Behavior for General Queries**
    * **Non-Domain-Specific Queries (e.g., O2C questions)**
      * *Trigger Condition*: When the user query does not relate to either order management or customer support.
      * *Action*: Supervisor Agent routes the query to a **knowledge retrieval system** and returns the most relevant answer **directly without stating fallback context**.
    ---

    ###  **Design Principles**
    * **Intent Recognition First**: Clearly detect and route based on user input context.
    * **Delegation, Not Duplication**: Does not handle detailed tasks but ensures the right agent is activated.
    * **Natural Interaction Flow**: Smooth transitions without disrupting the user experience.
    * **No Overlap Between Agents**: Maintains clear boundaries to avoid confusion.
    * **Direct Answers for O2C and Other Topics**: No extra framing or disclaimers‚Äîonly the relevant response.
    ```

    Test the agent behavior in the **Preview** section by asking the following sample question:

    Question: 

    ```Show me all emails for customer service```

    ```customers list```

    Expand the **Show Reasoning**, **Step 1**, and **Step 2** links to review the reasoning of the agent. Note that it is correctly retreiving information as it references the **Customer Support Agent** tool.
    ![wxo knowledge base test](./images/img25.png) 

53. Continue testing your agent now by stressing the order management agent functionality and Knowledge base. To do so, ask the following question.

    Question:

    ```Show me all order details``` 

    ```manage orders```

    ![order management](./images/img25-0.png)

54. At this point, you are ready to deploy your **Order-to-Cash Agent**. To do so, scroll to the bottom of the configuration page and make sure the slide bar next to **Show agent** is enabled (green) to make the **Order-to-Cash Agent** accessible on the chat interface. Click **Deploy** button to deploy your agent. Then click deploy again on the popup window.
![wxo  agent deploy](./images/img24.png)

*Congratulations!!* You have just developed and deployed the **Order-to-Cash Agent**.

## Experience Agents in Action using watsonx Orchestrate Chat UI

Now that you have deployed your **Order-to-Cash Agent**, you can interact with the agent using watsonx Orchestrate Conversational Interface.

55. Click the top left navigation menu and select **Chat** to access the conversational interface.
![wxo chat ui](./images/wxo-chat-ui.png)

56. On the **Chat UI**, note that now you have the **Order-to-Cash** as one of the available agents you can chat with. As you add more and more agents, you can select which agent you'd like to interact with by selecting the agent drop down list.
With the **Order-to-Cash Agent** selected, try interacting by asking the following question and observe the response.

    Question: 

    ```Show me all emails for customer service```

    ``` customers list```

    ![wxo chat q1](./images/img26.png)

57. Expand the **Show Reasoning** and **Step 1** sections to investigate the agent's reasoning in retrieving the response from **customer support agent** tool and continue to have a conversation with the customer support workflow. 

    ![wxo chat q1 reasoning](./images/img26copy.png)
    ![wxo chat q1](./images/img27.png)
    ![wxo chat q1](./images/img27.1.png)

58. Next, ask the following question to get response from knowledge base.

    Question:

    ```What should I do if there is an issue with my order delivery, such as delays or damaged goods ```

    ```What payment methods are accepted?```

    Expand the **Show Reasoning** and **Step 1** sections to investigate the agent's reasoning in retrieving the response. In this case, the agent leverages the **knowledge base** to retrieve the response.

    ![wxo chat q2](./images/img28.png)

59. Next, try another question to retrieve the order details.

    Question: 

    ```Show me all orders```

    Expand the **Show Reasoning** section and observe that the agent took 2 steps to retrieve the response for this question.

60. Now, let's try to explore what are the steps taken.
Expand the **Step 1** and **Step 2** sections and observe the agent transferring the request to the **Order Management Agent** to provide the order details of particular user.

## Conclusion
**Congratulations** on completing the hands-on lab portion of the bootcamp. 

To recap, you have used watsonx Orchestrate no-code functionality to develop a **Order-to-Cash Agent** skilled at helping order placement, invoicing, enhance customer satisfaction, accelerate cash flow, and deliver measurable impact to the bottom line by integrating intelligent agents and enterprise systems. You then added knowledge to the agent by uploading knowledge documents in the form of pdf files capturing O2C information.

Next, you augmented the **Order-to-Cash Agent** capabilities by developing two other agents, the **Order Management** and the **Customer Support Agent** which are empowered with tools to execute order management queries and also retrieve information from customer support regarding you order.
